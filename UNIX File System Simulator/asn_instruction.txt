1. discuss the data that you need to concern yourselves with and how to access it
2. discuss operations that should be supported by your class and how to execute them.

build a file manager class
	using a collection of system calls and file I/O operations
	each object handle a single file

	Name
		the name of the file --> class constructor
	
	Type 
		regular file / directory
		retrieved file type using stat()'s st_mode field
			string or numeric code <- stat()'s st_mode

	Size
		using stat()'s st_size

	Owner
		who own the file
			stat()'s st_uid field
		keep the numeric user ID
		keep string user name, getpwuid()

	Group
		the group of the file
			stat()'s st_gid
		keep the group ID
		keep group name, getgrgid()

	Permissions
		rwx of the file
			string or numeric code <- stat()'s st_mode

	Access time
		last access time
			stat()'s st_aim

	modification time
		last modification
			stat()'s st_mtim

	status change time
		stat()'s st_ctim

	block size
		use to determine the optimal chunk size for I/O operation for the file
			stat()'s st_blksize

	children(default null, interact with expand member function)
		if file is firectory:
			contains a collection of the file objects
		using vector is better than array

	error number(initialized to 0, 0 on each successful operation)
		errno var will be set if wrong

		cache the value from the most recent operation executed on this object

		if failed, get value of errno
